This is the first project of the 42 Wolfsburg Software Engineering School.
 
The objective of the project is to create our own C standard library in an attempt to understand how a number of common functions work.
 
For a number of future assignments, we will be able to use this self-made library where we will become more familiar with the replicated 
functions, their proper implementation and use.
 
# Usage
 
Use `make` to compile the mandatory functions and `make bonus` to compile with bonus functions.
